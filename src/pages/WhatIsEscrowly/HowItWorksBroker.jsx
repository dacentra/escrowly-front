                                        <h3>Facilitate Crypto Deals. Earn Trust. Get Paid.</h3>
                                        <p>People constantly rely on brokers to bring stability to the world of crypto deals, which is in a state of constant uncertainty. You can feel protected as well as obtain compensation through Escrowly whether you guide secure P2P crypto escrow transactions, handle cross-border crypto escrow services, or arrange high-value crypto deals between buyers and sellers.</p>
                                        <p>The pioneering crypto-only escrow platform Escrowly.com delivers an easy method for brokers to handle transactions that combine USDT and USDC, which are the most secure and reliable digital assets.</p>
                                        <p>Either you are brokering domain name deals, digital items? Online Art etc, Escrowly.com is your perfect partner in making it easily to close the deal!</p>
                                        <p>Here’s how it works:</p>
                                        <h3>Step 1: Set Up the Deal</h3>
                                        <p>By finding your way to your Escrowly dashboard, you can initiate an exchange. All you need to do is enter the following transaction details:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>1. Buyer and Seller Info</li>
                                            <li>2. Item or Service Description</li>
                                            <li>3. Agreed Terms</li>
                                            <li>4. Your Broker Commission</li>
                                            <li>5. Confidential Deal - Conceals Buyer and Seller emails for an enhanced transaction privacy</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>The Escrowly.com platform develops a specific smart contract escrow, which establishes secure terms and funds distribution for every participant.</p>
                                        <h3>Step 2: Buyer Deposits Funds</h3>
                                        <p>At this stage, the buyer has to securely deposit USDT or USDC funds into the escrow wallet for crypto. Stablecoins maintain a constant value during transactions, which eliminates unexpected price changes during the process. Everyone maintains confidence in the transaction because the funds are locked down safely in decentralized escrow services.</p>
                                        <h3>Step 3: Seller Delivers, Broker Oversees</h3>
                                        <p>Once the security of the funds is confirmed, the seller executes the delivery of their goods or service completion. During the exchange, the broker has to verify that the transaction follows all stated terms. The control you maintain in escrow transactions prevails in every case, including escrow for car lease payments, escrow for real estate closings, and escrow for business acquisitions - all while your exposure remains minimal.</p>
                                        <h3>Step 4: Funds are Disbursed & Commission is Paid</h3>
                                        <p>Both the buyer and the seller confirm the transaction, or you, as the verified broker, verify the agreement for the contract to disburse payments to the seller and send your commission automatically. No chasing clients. No manual splits. Every commercial deal features automatic trust mechanisms.</p>
                                        <h3>Wanted to Keep the Deal Confidential?</h3>
                                        <blockquote>The broker can create a “Confidential Transaction” assuring the Buyer and Seller are not visible to each other , The Broker will be handling from Start to Finish the whole process of the transactions that means full confidentiality on the deals making the broker a super broker to manage and control the deal.</blockquote>
