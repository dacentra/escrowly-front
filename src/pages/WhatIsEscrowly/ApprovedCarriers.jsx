                                        <h3>Safe, Trusted, and Verified Transport for Every Escrow Transaction</h3>
                                        <p>The secure delivery process holds equal importance to payment security during the transfer of valuable goods from watches to industrial equipment and used cars. Our partner network of specific carriers collaborates with Escrowly to provide secure delivery that supports our cryptographic escrow service and proven carrier service. Escrowly provides end-to-end protected services that extend from cryptocurrency transactions to secure cargo delivery across all escrow payment types, such as escrow for car dealership payments, escrow for second-hand car sales, and escrow and machinery and heavy equipment purchases.</p>
                                        <blockquote>Crypto may move at the speed of light—but physical items still need wheels. Escrowly bridges both worlds: using smart contracts for secure crypto transactions, and approved carriers for safe delivery.</blockquote>
                                        <h3>Why Use Approved Carriers?</h3>
                                        <p>The Escrowly platform establishes an ecosystem that safeguards all groups involved in trade transactions, from buyers to sellers and brokers, regardless of industry. The transaction security provided by smart contract escrow and blockchain escrow works with our approved carrier network to secure physical goods transfer.</p>
                                        <p>Using Escrowly's logistics partners means:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>1. Real-time tracking</li>
                                            <li>2. Verified pickup and delivery</li>
                                            <li>3. Chain-of-custody documentation</li>
                                            <li>4. Insurance options for high-value goods</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>The platform stretches around the world to provide coverage through vetted operators for all transactions.</p>
                                        <p>Delivery remains essential for trading foreign borders through cross-border crypto escrow as well as for selling local rare collectibles. An efficient crypto escrow system demands reliable shipping solutions as a necessary feature.</p>
                                        <h3>How Carrier Approval Works</h3>
                                        <p>We perform inspection on all carriers in a process similar to the security procedures we use in our crypto escrow operations. Escrowly’s network requires partners to fulfill rigorous quality standards that must be satisfied before joining.</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Compliance and Licensing: Every transportation company must adhere to transport legislation at both regional and international standards.</li>
                                            <li>Reputation and Reviews: Our team investigates customer evaluations, examines delivery performance and past dispute occurrences.</li>
                                            <li>Secure Handling: Companies operating in different industry categories must establish specific guidelines to handle their shipment types.</li>
                                            <li>API Integration: The best carriers within Escrowly provide live shipment tracking as an API feature that feeds directly into their dashboard.</li>
                                            <li>Insurance and Dispute Support: Escrowly requires providers to deliver protection plans and their staff participation for dispute management.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <h3>Can I Use My Own Carrier?</h3>
                                        <p>The use of Escrowly-approved carriers is recommended strongly for complete protection; however, you can still choose your own carrier. Using your own shipping provider provides flexibility, but Escrowly recommends its selected carriers for full coverage.</p>
