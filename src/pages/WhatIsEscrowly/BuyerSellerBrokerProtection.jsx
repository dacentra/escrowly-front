                                        <p>In the crypto space, one single mistake can drain tens of thousands, if not millions, of dollars because there is no mechanism to reverse transactions. Therefore, all crypto payments become permanent because they cannot be reversed. Anytime you make the transfer and press "send", the funds vanish permanently. No bank to call. No chargeback to issue. No second chances.</p>
                                        <p>This is where Escrowly comes into play. This platform is a breath of fresh air that was designed to change the entire game! Escrowly stands as the first crypto escrow platform because all its functions were designed specifically for the blockchain age as opposed to being adapted from traditional payment methods. We create a safe platform that uses Stablecoins like USDT and USDC to unite buyers and sellers together with brokers.</p>
                                        <h3>For Buyers: Say Goodbye to Scams & Stress</h3>
                                        <p>It can be frustrating to not receive anything from the seller, when you are using cryptocurrency to buy something online. You are most definitely not alone.</p>
                                        <p>People who make purchases with cryptocurrency stand as the most endangered group in online transactions. The Escrowly crypto escrow platform utilizes a secure escrow wallet for crypto where payments remain safe until all conditions from both parties are satisfied. Funds are only released after you verify that either the delivery was successful or the work was properly completed.</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Escrow smart contracts crypto technology securing the entire cryptocurrency transaction process</li>
                                            <li>The platform accepts payments through two stablecoins USDT and USDC</li>
                                            <li>Instant refunds in case of disputes</li>

                                        </ul>

                                        <h3>For Sellers: Get Paid Without the Risk</h3>
                                        <p>Crypto sellers encounter several additional difficulties because they must manage fake buyers as well as bounced payments and delayed payment settlements. With Escrowly, you can be rest assured that you will get the money you are owed because buyers must place their funds in escrow upon making their transaction.</p>
